        ### 🎯 The Science of Personalized Nutrition
        
        As a world-renowned dietitian, I believe a nutrition plan is not a set of rules to follow, 
        but a **personalized blueprint** for nourishing your unique body and life.
        
        **Why 15 Questions?**
        - Generic plans are destined to fail
        - Your body, lifestyle, and goals are unique
        - Every recommendation will be tailored specifically to YOU
        
        **What You'll Get:**
        - Scientifically calculated calorie and macro targets
        - Meal plans based on your preferences and cooking skills
        - Strategies that fit your lifestyle and budget
        - Success metrics that matter to YOU
